String Reduction: 

Given a string consisting of letters, a, b and c, we can perform the following operation: Take any two adjacent distinct characters and replace them with the third character. For example, if 'a' and 'c' are adjacent, they can replaced by 'b'. Find the smallest string which we can obtain by applying this operation repeatedly?

Input: 
The first line contains the number of test cases T. T test cases follow. Each test case contains the string you start with.

Output: 
Output T lines, one for each test case, containing the smallest length of the resultant string after applying the operations optimally.

Constraints: 
```sh
1 <= T <= 100 
The string will have at most 100 characters.
```

Sample Input: 
```sh
3 
cab 
bcab 
ccccc
```
Sample Output: 
```sh
2 
1 
5
```
Explanation: 
```sh
For the first case, you can either get cab -> cc or cab -> bb, resulting in a string of length 2. 
For the second case, one optimal solution is: bcab -> aab -> ac -> b. No more operations can be applied and the resultant string has length 1. 
For the third case, no operations can be performed. So the answer is 5.
```
